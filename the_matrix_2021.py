# You are given an N Ã— N matrix in which every cell is colored black or white.
# Columns are numbered from 0 to N-1 (from left to right). This coloring is
# represented by a non-empty array of integers A. If the K-th number in the array
# is equal to X then the X lowest cells in the K-th column of the matrix are
# black. The rest of the cells in the K-th column are white. The task is to
# calculate the side length of the biggest black square (a square containing only
# black cells).
# 
# Write a function:
# 
#     def solution(A)
# 
# that, given an array of integers A of length N representing the coloring of the
# matrix, returns the side length of the biggest black square.
